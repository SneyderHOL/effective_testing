Drawing a picture of a your data and then you translate that picture into a set of databases commands and shapes to create it.

Data model - the soul of an application

Building a Data Model
- Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships.

- Basic rule: Don't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead.

- When there is one thing in the "real world" there should only be one copy of that thing in the database.

For each "piece of info" ...
- Is the column an object or an attribute of another object?
- Once we define objects, we need to define the relationships between objects.

Three kinds of keys
- Primary key - generally an integer auto-increment field
- Logical key - what the outside world uses for lookup
- Foreing key - generally an integer key pointing to a row in another table

Primary key rules
Best practices:
- Never use your logical key as the primary key.
- Logical keys can and do change, albeit slowly.
- Relationships that are based on matching string fields are less efficient than integers.

Foreing keys
- Is when a table has a column containing a key that points to the primary key of another table.
- When all primary keys are integers, then all foreign keys are integers. This is good.

Normalization and foreign keys

Database Normalization (3NF)
There is 'ton' of database theory.
- Do not replicate data. Instead, reference data. Point at data.
- Use integers for keys and for references.
- Add a special 'key' column to each table, which you will make references to.

Integer reference pattern
We use integer columns in one table to reference (or look up) rows in another table.

Building a physical data schema
- Table, columns(attributes), keys(primary, logica, foreign)

Inserting normalized data

Creating our Music Database

$ sudo -u postgres psql postgres

=# CREATE DATABASE music WITH OWNER 'pg4e' ENCODING 'UTF8';

CREATE TABLE artist (id SERIAL, name VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY(id));
CREATE TABLE album (id SERIAL, title VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE, artist_id INTEGER REFERENCES artist(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, PRIMARY KEY(id));
CREATE TABLE genre (id SERIAL, name VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY(id));
CREATE TABLE track (id SERIAL, title VARCHAR(128), len INTEGER, rating INTEGER, count INTEGER, album_id INTEGER REFERENCES album(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, genre_id INTEGER REFERENCES genre(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, UNIQUE(title, album_id), PRIMARY KEY(id));

Inserting data
INSERT INTO artist (name) VALUES ('Led Zeppelin');
INSERT INTO artist (name) VALUES ('AC/DC');
INSERT INTO album (title, artist_id) VALUES ('Who Made Who', 2);
INSERT INTO album (title, artist_id) VALUES ('IV', 1);
INSERT INTO genre (name) VALUES ('Rock');
INSERT INTO genre (name) VALUES ('Metal');
INSERT INTO track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('Black Dog', 5, 297, 0, 2, 1);
INSERT INTO track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('Stairway', 5, 482, 0, 2, 1);
INSERT INTO track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('About to Rock', 5, 313, 0, 1, 2);
INSERT INTO track (title, rating, len, count, album_id, genre_id) VALUES ('Who Made Who', 5, 207, 0, 1, 2);

Using JOIN across tables
Relational power
- By removing the replicated data and replacing it with references to a single copy of each bit of data, we build a "web" of information that the relational database can read through very quickly - even for very large amounts of data.
- Often when you want some data it comes from a number of tables linked by these foreign keys.

The JOIN operation
- Links across several tables as part of a SELECT operation
- You must tell the JOIN how to use the keys that make the connection between the tables using ON clause.

INNER JOIN
means take the things that match
CROSS JOIN
means join everything

ON DELETE Choices
- Default / RESTRICT - Don't allow changes that break the constraint
- CASCADE - Adjust child rows by removing or updating to maintain consistency
- SET NULL - Set the foreign key columns in the child rows to null

Many to many
- Sometimes we need to model a relationship that is many to many.
- We need to add a "connection" table with two foreign keys.
- There is usually no separate primary key.

CREATE TABLE student(id SERIAL, name VARCHAR(128), email VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY(id));
CREATE TABLE course(id SERIAL, title VARCHAR(128) UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY(id));
CREATE TABLE member(student_id INTEGER REFERENCES student(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, course_id INTEGER REFERENCES course(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,  role INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY(student_id, course_id));

INSERT INTO student (name, email) VALUES ('Jane', 'jane@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO student (name, email) VALUES ('Ed', 'ed@tsugi.org');
INSERT INTO student (name, email) VALUES ('Sue', 'sue@tsugi.org');

INSERT INTO course (title) VALUES ('Python');
INSERT INTO course (title) VALUES ('SQL');
INSERT INTO course (title) VALUES ('PHP');

INSERT INTO member (student_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO member (student_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 1, 0);
INSERT INTO member (student_id, course_id, role) VALUES (3, 1, 0);
INSERT INTO member (student_id, course_id, role) VALUES (1, 2, 0);
INSERT INTO member (student_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 2, 1);
INSERT INTO member (student_id, course_id, role) VALUES (2, 3, 1);
INSERT INTO member (student_id, course_id, role) VALUES (3, 3, 0);

SELECT student.name, member.role, course.title FROM student JOIN member ON member.student_id = student.id JOIN course ON member.course_id = course.id ORDER BY course.title, member.role DESC, student.name;
